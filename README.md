# Neonate-Case

The data included in the client-ready exhibits contains inpatient hospital claims -- each record is a hospital discharge of a neonate that spent time in a NICU (neonate intensive care unit). 


This case study compares the length of stay of neonate cases that have been managed by an external contractors (Managed) and comparing them to their unmanaged cases (Unmanaged) and to an external benchmark (NPIC).
